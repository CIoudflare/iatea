        <h1>I Ate a Cherry</h1>
        <p>Cherries are small, vibrant red or dark purple fruits that are not only delicious but also packed with nutrients. With a sweet and slightly tart flavor, they make a delightful addition to both sweet and savory dishes. Cherries are known for their antioxidant properties and are a good source of vitamins, particularly vitamin C. These juicy, bite-sized fruits are a popular choice for snacking, baking, and creating refreshing summer beverages. Whether enjoyed fresh, frozen, or in jams and pies, cherries are a delightful taste of summer.</p>
